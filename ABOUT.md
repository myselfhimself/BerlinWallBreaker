This food and stop-motion based p5js low-tech video game was made slowly from November 2019 to June 2021 in Caen, Normandy, France.
The low-tech aspect of this video-game (cookie-less, database-less, 1 html page per section) is so, in order not to keep track of anyone (no visits counter), and also so that the game works smoothly on a computer as old as a year 2008 Lenovo T400 - which was used for most programming hours.

Cities of Caen and Le Havre are depicted because a boy and a girl lived apart in those cities after moving from Czech Republic and Canada.

This video game entitled "Berlin Wall Breaker" is a message-present by the boy to the girl, asking her, if she would agree that the thick wall of relationship silence between them be broken. This wall is as thick as a Berlin wall.

Since nothing can buy love, this work is an attempt to start to reconstruct a friendship in the midst of an apparent eternal impossibility.

Perseverance in rewriting and finishing this game has been namely grown during a summer 2020 1500km-long bike trip from Caen (France) to Santiago de Compostela (Spain) over Laval, Mayenne, Saint-Emilion, Nerac, Lourdes, Roncesvalles, Burgos (Via Frances).
